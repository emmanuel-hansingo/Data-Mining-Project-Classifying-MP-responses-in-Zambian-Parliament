2399,HIGH ELECTRICITY CONNECTION FEES,Mr Speaker April 2022 Zesco Limited applied Energy Regulation Board ERB upward revision connection fees standard connections relating three customer categories namely
2400,HIGH ELECTRICITY CONNECTION FEES,Mr Speaker application necessitated numerous challenges hindering provision quality services including prompt connection new applications electricity It worth noting connection fees last revised 2005 means eighteen years since fees adjusted Over period cost materials required connecting customers electricity well labour transport increased substantially
2401,HIGH ELECTRICITY CONNECTION FEES,Mr Speaker result reflective connection fees Zesco Limited use funds meant operations maintenance cover funding gap unsustainable years compromised service delivery existing would customers This funding gap also resulted outstanding connection accumulating paid connection applications backlog As 31st December 2021 paid application dating far back 2014 continuing status quo entails Zesco Limited operational maintenance budgets stretched even customers would continue subjected poor service delivery
2402,HIGH ELECTRICITY CONNECTION FEES,Mr Speaker upon receiving application Zesco Limited ERB reviewed accordance provisions Energy Regulation Act No 12 2019 Electricity Act No 11 2019 As part review process board called public comments April 2022 May 2022 All written submissions comments reviewed comprehensively public hearing Consequently ERB considered approved new Zesco Limited connection fees came effect January 1 2023

3560,UPGRADING OF HOSPITALS TO GENERAL HOSPITALS COUNTRYWIDE,The Minister Health Mrs Masebo Madam Speaker Government Republic Zambia total general hospitals distributed follows
3561,UPGRADING OF HOSPITALS TO GENERAL HOSPITALS COUNTRYWIDE,Madam Speaker Government plans upgrade hospitals general hospital level The upgrading hospitals ongoing programme So far good number upgraded The exact number hospitals upgraded established exercise determining hospital upgraded completed
3562,UPGRADING OF HOSPITALS TO GENERAL HOSPITALS COUNTRYWIDE,Mr Miyutu Madam Speaker I want find Government going work two types hospitals general hospitals Is provision going lower rate upgrading hospitals general hospitals two programmes
3563,UPGRADING OF HOSPITALS TO GENERAL HOSPITALS COUNTRYWIDE,Mrs Masebo Madam Speaker question clear I try answer I understood rightly
3564,UPGRADING OF HOSPITALS TO GENERAL HOSPITALS COUNTRYWIDE,Madam Speaker basically would call health centre urban rural area So basically one would assume health centre A general hospital well district hospital So initially call health post lowest level This smallest health facility categorise
3565,UPGRADING OF HOSPITALS TO GENERAL HOSPITALS COUNTRYWIDE,Madam Speaker second health post call health centre slightly bigger health post We call urban health centres rural health centres within category Above call district hospital like one Chongwe Above district hospital called general hospital like Kabwe General Hospital Livingstone General Hospital Above general hospital called tertiary hospital These hospitals like University Teaching Hospital UTH Levy Mwanawasa University Teaching Hospital LMUTH Then tertiary hospital call Specialised Hospital These specific specialised hospitals like Cancer Diseases Hospital CDH National Heart Disease Hospital
3566,UPGRADING OF HOSPITALS TO GENERAL HOSPITALS COUNTRYWIDE,So I understood question correctly hon Member wanted know whether going upgraded general hospitals The hon Member remember purposes second level hospital second level district hospital So general hospital much advanced
3567,UPGRADING OF HOSPITALS TO GENERAL HOSPITALS COUNTRYWIDE,Mr Miyutu Madam Speaker I seem confused two types hospitals general hospitals From hon Minister saying indicated general hospital advanced Now Government promote general hospitals Why Government come instead upgrading district hospitals general hospitals offer advances services Why Government centre decision upgrading hospitals general hospitals
3568,UPGRADING OF HOSPITALS TO GENERAL HOSPITALS COUNTRYWIDE,Mrs Masebo Madam Speaker hon Member wants know Government building instead upgrading hospitals general hospitals Maybe way answer question state level hospital specific function terms service delivery treatment A health post dealing minor problems like health issues community level A general hospital obviously dealing complicated operations So need system health delivery reduce congestion big hospitals
3569,UPGRADING OF HOSPITALS TO GENERAL HOSPITALS COUNTRYWIDE,You want person small cut rushing general hospital go health post We want referral system helps managing cases manner put pressure higher level This system starts lower level upper level
3570,UPGRADING OF HOSPITALS TO GENERAL HOSPITALS COUNTRYWIDE,Madam Speaker question concentrating smaller hospitals instead bigger hospitals considering bigger hospitals offer treatment When smaller hospitals community level helps prevent diseases I call smaller hospitals preventive level If health service delivery less patients high level However concentrate top two things happen Firstly congestion top Secondly means lower level nobody dealing basic issues prevention education So want system good facilities You remember good olden days told keep first aid box house So starting point house When one situation got worse one went first level clinic If became worser one went second level clinic lastly third level clinic Basically system
3571,UPGRADING OF HOSPITALS TO GENERAL HOSPITALS COUNTRYWIDE,Madam Speaker ensure every district levels service delivery For example health post general clinic district hospital provincial hospital national hospital specialised hospital These hospitals well distributed ten provinces nobody comes Lusaka For example one cancer hospital Lusaka people provinces come Lusaka problems accommodation One would say decentralise Why cancer hospital regions ten provinces So question planning looking population disease burden factors normally influence particular establishment
3572,UPGRADING OF HOSPITALS TO GENERAL HOSPITALS COUNTRYWIDE,Madam Speaker need take account human resource factor There may high level hospitals without necessary staffing I know Zambia last two decades done quite well trying improve human resource Once upon time Zambia could produce fifty doctors space two three years even doctors street So many factors consider matter saying let us kind general hospital You also note hospitals declared general hospitals district hospitals pronouncement equipment human resource hospitals It theory declaring certain areas districts nothing An area called district District Commissioner people appointed look area nothing So principle
3573,UPGRADING OF HOSPITALS TO GENERAL HOSPITALS COUNTRYWIDE,Madam Speaker methodical Government since took office might noticed declared anything We studying situation come proper analysis situation currently one district three two district hospitals districts nothing In places much required structures becoming white elephants So carrying study understand decide example construct general hospital many health posts clinics need forth With time come House give proper plan upgrades least next five years We indicate next five years follow plan
3574,UPGRADING OF HOSPITALS TO GENERAL HOSPITALS COUNTRYWIDE,I thank Madam Speaker
3575,UPGRADING OF HOSPITALS TO GENERAL HOSPITALS COUNTRYWIDE,Madam First Deputy Speaker I take last three questions hon Member Lumezi hon Member Kabwata hon Member Bwana Mkubwa In order

3581,UPGRADING OF HOSPITALS TO GENERAL HOSPITALS COUNTRYWIDE,Madam Speaker many factors consider upgrading hospitals Every district wants district hospital general hospital specialised hospital However many factors consider resources population disease burden also balance equity So factors come play For example Eastern Province mission hospital operating general hospital able provide certain activities treatment provided district level So hospital necessary equipment human resource skilled doctors certain operations example Those things enable us move hospital next level However like I said desirous district hospital general hospital every province district looking population Would good every province specialised hospital All things desire many things definitely come play
3582,UPGRADING OF HOSPITALS TO GENERAL HOSPITALS COUNTRYWIDE,Madam Speaker hon Member first statement important would good raised question bring answer specifically tell district hospital declared general hospital health post changed health centre plans Government build new district hospitals built It important statement bring substantive question

5887,RATE,The Minister Finance National Planning Dr Musokotwane Mr Speaker let start talking
5888,RATE,Mr Speaker discussing recent increase Statutory Reserve Ratio important first state understand role Bank Zambia BoZ The Constitution Zambia well Bank Zambia Act 2022 passed last year House provides BoZ focus price financial stability key mandates Indeed Bank Zambia Act 2022 emphasis primacy price stability mandate
5889,RATE,Mr Speaker let inform House price stability simply mean overall level prices increase moderate pace time financial system stability mean financial sector institutions able carry functions looking savings individuals providing credit business households looking invest economy The legislative framework BoZ operates also enhanced autonomy institutions BoZ able make decisions without undue influence vagaries political cycle especially times elections
5890,RATE,Mr Speaker framework adopted Zambia Ministry Finance National Planning provides inflation targets BoZ currently ensure inflation within six eight per cent band end year The BoZ uses instruments disposal achieve target From 2012 BoZ adopted new policy framework key tool adjustment Monetary Policy Rate signal changes monetary policy In fact countries African adopted framework using policy rate rather directly targeting money supply precisely high powered reserve money consists cash outside banking system well commercial bank deposits held BoZ
5891,RATE,Mr Speaker countries use policy rate framework include South Africa Uganda Kenya Nigeria amongst others However framework work well requires mature financial sector usually case developing countries It reason monetary policy tools economies still include use time time direct influence monetary aggregates adjustments statutory reserve ratios example

5962,RATE,Mr Speaker important say adjustments rates talking standard policy tools exist central banks world The Bank England sometimes increases rates sometimes lowers The European Central Bank sometimes lowers rates sometimes increases rates In South Africa sometimes increase rates sometimes lower rates So nothing strange There nothing strange adjusting rates either way another It something happens world
5963,RATE,Mr Speaker rates increased primarily depreciation exchange rate The depreciation exchange rate one main driver adjusting rates upwards The Questioner said Government already spent much dollars intervene necessary The simple reason measures direct intervention direct sales dollars enough light excessive pressure caused excessive external borrowing So measures hon Member talked enough Therefore became necessary put additional measures place help stabilise exchange rate
5964,RATE,Mr Speaker matter likened houses We want water house We want water bedroom floor kitchen However saw house catching fire would get water would want place quench fire Normally like house wet fire need water quench fire

11217,ASSIST FARMERS WITH MAIZE EXPORT,The essence Motion Madam Speaker promote growth agriculture ensuring farmers maximise profits maize production This enable improve productivity graduate medium farmers In improving livelihood also contributing national economic development job creation poverty reduction
11218,ASSIST FARMERS WITH MAIZE EXPORT,Madam Speaker outset I would like underscore fact farmers important Zambia agriculture sector account higher percentage terms production field output Through production substantially contribute entire agriculture output
11219,ASSIST FARMERS WITH MAIZE EXPORT,Madam emphasise aforesaid may wish note farmers main suppliers maize FRA institution mandated manage strategic food reserves country Based aforementioned undebatable farmers ones feeding nation vital food security country In regard plight top priority Government relevant stakeholders
11220,ASSIST FARMERS WITH MAIZE EXPORT,Madam Speaker notwithstanding highlighted contribution farmers largely remained undeveloped failed graduate medium farmers terms production productivity This successive Governments subdued price maize ensuring political expedience detriment farmers In addition farmers lacked access alternative lucrative competitive markets maize negatively affects profitability
11221,ASSIST FARMERS WITH MAIZE EXPORT,Madam Speaker allow emphasise majority farmers grow maize staple food Zambia also widely consumed Africa across globe various forms According Mordor Intelligence organisation monitors market trends Africa consumes 30 per cent total maize produced globally despite contributing 7 per cent total production
11222,ASSIST FARMERS WITH MAIZE EXPORT,Madam meanwhile global cereal demand 2020 estimated billion metric tonnes wheat outstripping maize However first time indicated major shift global cereal demand maize 852 million metric tonnes compared wheat 760 metric tonnes This entails commodity higher demand within African continent beyond For instance Democratic Republic Congo DRC price maize 50 kg bag K450 2021 In year average price Kenya Zimbabwe 50 kg bag maize K380 K400 respectively
11223,ASSIST FARMERS WITH MAIZE EXPORT,It expected maize continue fetch premium price international market If farmers assisted export maize markets high prices maximise profits In turn able acquire necessary inputs improve productivity graduate medium farmers This would easily enable Government remove farmers Farmer Input Support Programme FISP three years initially intended
11224,ASSIST FARMERS WITH MAIZE EXPORT,Madam Speaker fact farmers still subjected low prices determined Food Reserve Agency FRA means able make profit motivated improve productivity This situation forces Government continuously spend colossal sums money subsidise farmers without getting significant benefit
11225,ASSIST FARMERS WITH MAIZE EXPORT,Madam Speaker view find prudent farmers assisted access competitive markets maximise profits able reinvest improved output
11226,ASSIST FARMERS WITH MAIZE EXPORT,Madam Speaker I appreciate fact Government liberalised trade market maize farmers allowed export maize market either local international However ought consider farmers lack capacity facilitate sale maize nearest local markets let alone international markets

11228,ASSIST FARMERS WITH MAIZE EXPORT,Madam Speaker currently situation FRA buys maize low price farmers exports higher price After paying farmers maize supplied profit accrues FRA What proposing therefore FRA meets strategic reserves target buying maize local price extra maize farmers belong exported behalf proceeds paid farmers deducting fees logistics
11229,ASSIST FARMERS WITH MAIZE EXPORT,Madam Speaker I also aware may concerns adopting putting place measures implement proposal Motion may jeopardise food security country To allay fears Government put mechanism whereby FRA allowed export maize reached target strategic reserves
11230,ASSIST FARMERS WITH MAIZE EXPORT,In regard guard farmers may want hold maize policy could put place FRA exports maize behalf farmers would sold certain percentage maize strategic reserves determined floor price This would situation farmers would encouraged produce maize sell certain percentage FRA strategic food reserves export rest maximum profit Ultimately would able see growth among farmers elimination perpetual dependence Government farming inputs In addition would line Eighth National Development Plan 8NDP aims among others promote agricultural productivity enterprise development enhancing access regional international markets
11231,ASSIST FARMERS WITH MAIZE EXPORT,Madam Speaker conclusion allow reiterate farmers important agricultural sector economy large They offer sure way creating sustainable employment reducing poverty However lack capacity export maize lucrative markets briefcase buyers flood rural areas buy maize cheap prices In turn make super profits expense poor rural farmers As result farmers perpetually use outdated methods farming Therefore important assisted export maize best markets order increase profits Doing would empower financially reduce dependence Government farming inputs Eventually could able graduate medium farmers increased contribution national economic development employment creation poverty reduction

13272,ACTING CHIEF WHIP,Mr Chairperson Ministry Finance National Planning responsible policy I looking programmes ministry Programme 3422 3420 relate economic policy management If hon Minister instructs experts couch policies give incentives mines give If give instructions couch policies give incentives growth SMEs It money aspect alone important Money one issue That give money give people loans
13273,ACTING CHIEF WHIP,Mr Chairperson SMEs collapse first two three years What incentives going give Do ensure certain taxes paid SMEs grow If grow money giving come back economy So I request I hope take request seriously I hope experts Ministry Finance National Planning also take issue seriously Economic policy management important What policy govern growth SMEs What policy govern growth Zambian businesses If deal issue able achieve intend achieve

13282,ACTING CHIEF WHIP,Mr Chairperson fiscal management I thinking domestic revenue mobilisation hon Minister wants focus terms improving systems institutions Government responsible mobilising domestic revenue He talked Zambia Revenue Authority ZRA I many problems ZRA systems place already work well The ZRA seems meeting targets sometimes even going beyond targets However I question Maybe targets setting high need adjust The hon Minister talked National Road Fund Agency NRFA Of course toll gates well With Partnerships PPPs coming course activity area
13283,ACTING CHIEF WHIP,Mr Chairperson I thinking Revenue NTR By virtue member Planning Budgeting Committee I interacted witnesses presented Committee study NTR
13284,ACTING CHIEF WHIP,We opportunity visit Uganda use different system collect revenue Of course use Control 99 monies gets mopped Control 99 However jurisdictions institutions like universities collect money involvement revenue authority Here institutions collect revenue without involving experienced collecting revenue thereby leaving decide revenue collect Of course another example local authorities By law local authorities collect money spend source Therefore little control hon Minister office money accounted spent This gives birth next point I want make system controls governed Public Finance Management Act No 1 2018 Act also brings issue controller internal audits
13285,ACTING CHIEF WHIP,Mr Chairperson let talk Office Controller Internal Audits operating I heard hon Minister talk improving system enough financing must go office work Most issues come due weak internal controls So strength internal controls It controller internal audits Now listen works controller internal audits supposed supposed performance audits course value money audits supposed compliance audits checking transactions payments expenditure side ensure compliance Public Finance Management Act including procurement process Government wants refine For followed complied Office Controller Internal Audits needs strengthened There systems exist get beaten It functions strengthened nobody seems care ensure systems actually strengthened

13288,ACTING CHIEF WHIP,Mr Chairperson let briefly respond issues raised The first oneisthat Hon Mundubile feels emphasising much financial management aspect work enough planning economic management side things He said sometimes operate cylinders
13289,ACTING CHIEF WHIP,Mr Chairperson I want respond saying planning function actually important In manner today merged together finance makes function even better Most neighbouring countries would use old practice hon Ministers responsible finance planning ministry would sit different places people would operate cylinders This would plan would go town make sorts plans without referring financial resources available execute plans As I said countries two combined As plan also look purse decide plan realistic perhaps talking something wish list So buttress point I think number colleagues observed last year year Minister Finance National Planning working closely ministries For example working closely hon Minister Agriculture
